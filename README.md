### âœ¨ About This Journey

My journey into Flutter began with a simple question:
**"What if I could build beautiful, cross-platform apps from a single codebase?"**

What started as a small experiment quickly turned into a growing passion.
Through this project, Iâ€™ve explored the fundamentals of Flutter â€” including UI design, widget composition, state handling, and writing clean, maintainable code.

This repository showcases one of my first real-world attempts: a fully functional login and sign-up flow, complete with smooth navigation, custom form fields, validation logic, and a confirmation code screen.
