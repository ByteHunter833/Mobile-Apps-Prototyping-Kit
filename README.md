ðŸš€ Getting Started with Flutter: My Personal Journey

"Every great developer was once a beginner."â€” Inspired by curiosity, built with code.

âœ¨ About this Journey

My journey into Flutter began with a simple idea:What if I could build beautiful mobile apps with just one codebase?

What started as a small experiment soon turned into a passion.Through this project, Iâ€™ve explored the foundations of Flutter, UI design, state management, and clean code structure.

This repository represents one of my first hands-on experiences â€” building a complete login & sign-up flow with modern UI components, smooth transitions, and interactive input fields.
